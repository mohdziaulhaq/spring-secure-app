A default user is created with `username: user`

The password is autogenerated and displayed in the application logs
Example log output when the application starts:

Using generated security `password: 3b2c1d4f-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`

```
username: user
password: 3b2c1d4f-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```
## **Customizing Security Settings**
   If you want to define a custom username and password, add the following to your application.properties:

```
spring.security.user.name=admin
spring.security.user.password=admin123
```
